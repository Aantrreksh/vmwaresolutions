# Requirements and planning for NetApp ONTAP Select instances

Review the following requirements before you order your NetApp ONTAP Select instances. Plan your instance based on the IBM Cloud data center location and your workload performance and capacity requirements.

## IBM Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) account requirements

The Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) account that you are using must meet certain requirements. For more information, see [Bluemix Infrastructure account requirements](../vmonic/slaccountrequirement.html).
