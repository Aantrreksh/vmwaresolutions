# Getting started with IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions

The {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}} console is the interface where you order and manage your deployments. Each deployment is managed as an instance in the console. The console is a stand-alone user interface that is separate from the SoftLayer® Customer Portal.

**Note**: {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} is an English-only release. Therefore, all features on the console, including the product documentation, are available in English only.
