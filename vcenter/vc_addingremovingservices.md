# Ordering, viewing, and removing services for vCenter Server instances

You can order additional services for your VMware vCenter Server instances, such as a disaster recovery solution. When you no longer need these services, you can remove them from your instances.

You can order the Zerto disaster recovery service for your VMware vCenter Server instances, which provides replication and disaster
recovery capabilities to help protect your workloads. For more information, see [Zerto disaster recovery deployment](../vmonic/addingzertodr.html) and [Zerto disaster recovery removal](../vmonic/removingzertodr.html).
