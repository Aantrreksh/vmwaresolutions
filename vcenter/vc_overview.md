# Managing vCenter Server instances

VMware vCenter Server on IBM® Cloud is a hosted private cloud
that delivers the VMware vSphere stack as a service. The VMware
environment is built on top of a minimum of two Bluemix® bare
metal servers, shared file-level storage, and includes the
automatic deployment and configuration of an easy-to-manage
logical edge firewall that is powered by VMware NSX. 

The entire
environment can be provisioned in a matter of hours, and the
elastic bare metal infrastructure can scale out the compute
capacity rapidly when needed.

Post-deployment, you can order and manually attach additional NFS
(Network File System) file shares across hosts. If you purchased
IBM-provided VMware licensing, you can upgrade the VMware NSX
Base Edition to Advanced Edition or Enterprise Edition, and you
can purchase additional VMware software, such as VMware vRealize
Operations. 

IBM Cloud Professional Services and Managed Services
are also available to help you accelerate your journey to the
cloud with offerings like migration, implementation, and
onboarding services.
