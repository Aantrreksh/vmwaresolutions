# Requirements and planning for vCenter Server instances

Review the following requirements before you order your VMware vCenter Server instances. Plan your instance based on your location and workload capacity requirements.

## SoftLayer account requirements

The SoftLayer® account that you are using must meet certain requirements. For more information, see [SoftLayer account requirements](../vmonic/slaccountrequirement.html).

## Data centers availability

The vCenter Server deployment has strict requirements on the physical infrastructure. Therefore, you can deploy instances only in IBM® Cloud data centers that meet the requirements. The following data centers are available for vCenter Server deployment:
