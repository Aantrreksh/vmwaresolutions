# Getting started

Review important information about requirements and user accounts before starting to work with {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full}}.

## {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console

The {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console is the interface where you order and manage your deployments. Each deployment is managed as an instance in the console. The console is a stand-alone user interface that is separate from the IBM Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer) Customer Portal.

**Note**: {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} is an English-only release. Therefore, all features on the console, including the product documentation, are available in English only.

## IBMid

To access the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, you must have an **IBMid**.

{{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} is provided as an infrastructure solution in the BluemixÂ® catalog. Therefore, to use your **IBMid** to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, you must associate the **IBMid** with a Bluemix account.

When you log in to the console for the first time, you are guided to either associate your **IBMid** with a Bluemix account, or
to sign up for a new Bluemix account that is automatically associated with your **IBMid**. You need to go through this process only once.

If you have problems associating your **IBMid** with a Bluemix account, see [Troubleshooting for accessing Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/troubleshoot/ts_accessing.html){:new_window}.

The cost of the physical and virtual infrastructure and the resulting licenses are charged to your Bluemix Infrastructure account. For more information about account requirements, see [Bluemix Infrastructure account requirements](slaccountrequirement.html).

**Note**: You can associate only one Bluemix Infrastructure account to an {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} account.
