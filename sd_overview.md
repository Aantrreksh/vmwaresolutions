# Managing Cloud Foundation instances

When you order a VMware Cloud Foundation instance, an entire VMware environment is deployed automatically. The base deployment consists of four IBMÂ® Cloud bare metal servers with the VMware Cloud Foundation stack preinstalled and configured to provide a unified software-defined data center (SDDC) platform. Cloud Foundation natively integrates VMware vSphere, VMware NSX, VMware Virtual SAN, and is architected based on VMware Validated Designs.
