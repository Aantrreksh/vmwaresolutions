# Requirements and planning for Cloud Foundation instances

Review the following requirements before you order your VMware Cloud Foundation instances. Plan your instance based on your location and workload capacity requirements.

## SoftLayer account requirements

The IBM® SoftLayer® account that you are using must meet certain requirements. For more information, see [SoftLayer account requirements](../vmonic/slaccountrequirement.html).

## Data centers availability

The Cloud Foundation deployment has strict requirements on the physical infrastructure. Therefore, you can deploy instances only in IBM Cloud data centers that meet the requirements. The following data centers are available for Cloud Foundation deployment:

Table 1. Available data centers for Cloud Foundation instances
